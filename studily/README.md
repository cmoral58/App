# Studily - [Visit the website!](https://cmoral58.github.io/student-app/)

A new Flutter project.

# Studily - An app for Students

## Description

Studily is an application made for students created by students. This application will be to combat student issues like disorganization, failing to manage money, inability to stay healthy/active, poor academic achievements, poor sleeping habits, and procrastination.


# Sustainability Goal

Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being at all ages is essential to sustainable development. With Studily, students will be able to better maintain their physical and mental health. Students have several issues in their time in school and outside of it, ranging from them being unable to manage money, not being organized, having poor grades, having poor sleep and eating habits, and procrastination. My investigation method will include an app in which select students will be able to track such problems (i.e. track their budget, organize their tasks, etc.)
